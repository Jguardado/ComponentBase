Project ideas:
  - create a support network for families of incarcerated individuals
  - create a online avenue for free career mentorship/tutoring
  - create a mobile platform for early childhood computer literacy
  - create an app that tracks public transportation by specific trains or buses to determine if
    if one particular driver is constantly late. As well to create a forum for discussion about a particular driver/operator. This can be expanded to track regular riders, nuisances, disturbances.
  - create app that connects illegal immigrants with legal assistance.
  - create application that helps individuals navigate through citizenship process.
  - create an application that connects lower income schools(less funded) with pilot programs that support liberal arts, computer science, and mentorship.
  - create an application that tracks criminal arrests in a particular region by police officer, and offense. An tool to hold police departments accountable. This goes for citations and other disturbance calls. A way to highlight the potentially disproportionate levels of arrests or targeted communities.
  - create and online network of lending that helps children within a given community gain scholarships to schools and vocational programs.
