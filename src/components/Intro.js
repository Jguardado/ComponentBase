        compiled of commonly used a components and is intended for the use in personal
        construction of React websites. </p>
        <p className='headingtext tab'>The goal is to provide readily compatible code
        snippets that can be dropped into any project without the hassle of added NPM
        modules or a litany of documentation that must be read simply to determine whether
        or not this component is the right fit for your project.</p>

        <p className='headingtext tab'>This library is a work in progress.
        Being a product of the code I learned from other open source projects I welcome
        contributions and review. If there is a recommendation for best practice usage
        Im sure I can find a way to integrate that into this library as well.</p>
