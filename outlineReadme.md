xxName of project herexx is a library of ready to use React components built in Es6.

This library is compiled of commonly used a components and is for the use in personal construction of your own React websites
the goal is to provide readily compatible code snippets that can be dropped into any project without the hassle/
of added NPM modules or a litany of documentation that must be read simply to determine whether or not this component/
is the right fit for your project.

This library is a work in progress. Being a product of the code I learned from other open source projects I welcome contributions and review. If there is a recommendation for best practice usage I'm sure I can find a way to integrate that into this library as well.

If you find any of the components useful and happen to include them in your projects the only thing I ask is that you star the repo on github so that we can bring attention to the usefulness of this library to others who might not be aware of this.

Any recommendations for components can be submitted as github issues and will receive my fullest attention.
